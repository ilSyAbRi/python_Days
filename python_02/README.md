# 🌱 Garden Guardian – Smart Agriculture Data Engineering

## 📘 Overview
This project teaches how to build robust and fault-tolerant data pipelines for smart agriculture systems.  
You will process agricultural sensor data (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, etc.) and learn how to handle real-world farming problems safely.

Each exercise builds a part of a complete agricultural monitoring system, from basic sensor validation to full data monitoring and alerts.

---

## 🎯 What You Will Learn
- Validate and clean agricultural data in real time  
- Identify common IoT sensor failures (missing or invalid data)  
- Create custom alerts for crop-specific monitoring  
- Build fault-tolerant systems with recovery mechanisms  
- Maintain data integrity in distributed farming systems  

---

## ⚙️ General Instructions
- Programs must be written in **Python 3.10+**  
- Code must follow **flake8** standards  
- Each exercise must be in its **own file**  
- Include simple **docstrings** for functions and classes  
- Show both **normal operation** and **error scenarios**  
- Use built-in exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`, `Exception`)  
- Keep solutions simple and focused on learning  
- Programs must **never crash**  

---

## 🌾 Data Engineering Note
This project focuses on agricultural data engineering.  
Your code should demonstrate how to build fault-tolerant monitoring systems that handle real-world farming conditions while maintaining data integrity.

---

## ✅ Goal
Build a smart agriculture system that:
- reads sensor data  
- validates and cleans it  
- handles errors safely  
- generates alerts  
- and runs reliably without crashing  

You are the **Garden Guardian** 🛡️🌱
