## 🌟 What You Really Learn

- How to define and use a **class** in Python with `__init__` and methods.
- How to create an **object** from a class (`rose = Plant(...)`).
- How to change an object’s state over time using methods (`grow()` and `grow_older()`).
- How to use a **loop (`while`)** to simulate repeated actions (days passing).
- Understanding how data (height and age) can be updated step by step inside an object.
- Separating the **model** (Plant class) from the **execution logic** (day simulation and printing results).

This exercise is mainly about practicing:
- basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP),
- using loops for simple simulation,
- and structuring code in a clearer way.
