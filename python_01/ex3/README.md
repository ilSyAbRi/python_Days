# 🌱 Exercise 3 – Plant Factory
#### subject
```
The garden center needs to create many plants quickly using your Plant class with
different starting values. You need to streamline the plant creation process and initialize
them properly.
Requirements:
• Plants need to be created with their initial information (name, starting height,
starting age)
• Each plant should be ready to use immediately after construction
• Create at least 5 different plants with varying characteristics
• Display all created plants in an organized format
• Think about how you can streamline the plant creation process
Consider how you might set up plants with their starting values efficiently. What would
make creating many plants easier?
```
## 🎯 What I Learned

From this exercise, I mainly practiced and reinforced concepts I had already learned in previous exercises:

- Using the `__init__` method to initialize objects with different values  
- Reusing an existing class to create multiple instances  
- Storing objects inside a list  
- Looping through a list of objects  
- Calling a method for each object  
- Formatting output using f-strings  

This exercise helped me better understand how to work with multiple objects together in a small program.
